1.0 Introduction

Gamer’s Zone is a website developing an online shopping and selling marketplace.

2.0 Objective

To have a one click away shop for customers to buy the best gaming accessories and games.

3.0 Methodology

3.1 Technologies used

Redux
MongoDB
Routes

3.2 Tools to deploy 

Node Package Manager(NPM)
MongoDB v5.0.3 (Atlas URL/Localhost database)
Postman
Visual Studio Code
Google Chrome

3.3 Frontend

  	The front-end is built using a combination of technologies such as Hypertext Markup Language(HTML), Javascript and Cascading Style Sheets(CSS). Front-end developers design and construct the user experience elements on the web page or app including buttons, menus, pages, links, graphics and more.
 	 After using CSS in HTML, Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end web framework for designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only.
  	HTML provides the overall design and functionality. CSS gives developers a flexible, precise way to create attractive, interactive website designs. Javascript is useful for creating dynamic elements on static HTML web pages. It allows developers to access elements separate from the main HTML pages, as well as respond to server-side events.

3.4 Server

For the server platform, we have used MongoDB Atlas Database to support our database deployment.

3.5 Database Schema

For the database schema, it consists of two collections.
1. Product
name: type=string
description: type=string
imageURL: type=string
price: type=number
CcountInStock: type=number

2.User
name: type=string
lastname: type=string
username: type=string
email: type=string
password: type=string
isAdmin: type=string

4.0 Major Features In Application

4.1 Register

The register function enables users to register themselves to our webpage and to further authenticate them when they want to log into our website to receive further benefits. Other than that, the registered user data will be stored inside the MongoDB Atlas database.

4.2 Login

The login function enables users to login into our page securely and to receive future discounts from the shop.

4.3 Shopping Cart

The shopping cart added the calculation function where users can see the total price of the product that had been added. Other than that, the functionality of the page to remove and modify the number of products is one of the key highlights of the page, where it enables the freedom for users to manage the number of products to their likings.

5.0 Project Challenges

There are various challenges that have been faced by our team throughout the development. But the team managed to overcome it by having more brainstorming session and back to back discussion throughout the week. Below are the challenges:
Having limited knowledge to build the website.
Having limited time to meet with the team as individuals have their own errands to be made during the day.

6.0 Outcomes, Learning & Future Improvement

Our project has a lot of improvements for it to work better as a website in terms of functionality. But by far, our code is being used for future reference in any project that we want to make as our team has added the comments inside our code and side notes. Below are the future improvement that has to be made:

Product filtering and categorise according to customer’s need
Change number of products displayed per page in product page
Adding payment method
Sending email confirmation when purchased and during registration
Adding customer’s details such as address, phone number and email for delivery purposes.
